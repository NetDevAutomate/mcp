# AWS Network Firewall Policy Deep Analysis

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: The firewall policies are **RESTRICTIVE**, not permissive as initially assessed. This is a **default-deny** configuration that blocks most traffic by default.

## Policy Configuration: `firewall-policy-net-a-internet`

### Raw Policy Components
```json
{
  "StatelessDefaultActions": ["aws:forward_to_sfe"],
  "StatelessFragmentDefaultActions": ["aws:forward_to_sfe"],
  "StatefulDefaultActions": ["aws:drop_strict"],
  "StatefulEngineOptions": {
    "RuleOrder": "STRICT_ORDER",
    "StreamExceptionPolicy": "CONTINUE"
  },
  "StatelessRuleGroups": 0,
  "StatefulRuleGroups": 0
}
```

## Traffic Processing Flow

### 1. Stateless Layer Processing
- **Action**: `aws:forward_to_sfe`
- **Behavior**: Pass-through layer
- **Result**: ALL traffic forwarded to Stateful Firewall Engine
- **Impact**: No filtering at stateless layer

### 2. Stateful Layer Processing
- **Action**: `aws:drop_strict`
- **Rule Groups**: 0 custom groups
- **Engine**: `STRICT_ORDER` with `CONTINUE` stream policy
- **Result**: **DEFAULT DENY** - Unknown traffic blocked

## Critical Finding: `aws:drop_strict` Interpretation

### What This Actually Means:
- ‚ùå **DROP**: Unmatched traffic is **BLOCKED** by default
- üîí **STRICT**: Strict rule evaluation order enforced
- üìã **Only explicitly allowed traffic passes**

### Engine Options Impact:
- **STRICT_ORDER**: Rules evaluated in priority order (lowest first)
- **CONTINUE**: Malformed packets continue processing rather than dropping connection

## Traffic Analysis: Allowed vs Blocked

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED TRAFFIC (AWS Managed Exceptions)

#### 1. Established Connections (Return Traffic)
- TCP connections already established
- UDP sessions with recent outbound traffic
- Return packets for existing flows
- **Use Case**: Web browsing return traffic, API responses

#### 2. TCP Connection Establishment (Conditional)
- TCP SYN responses for inbound connections
- TCP handshake completion packets
- **Use Case**: Server responses to client connections

#### 3. ICMP Essential Messages
- ICMP error messages (unreachable, time exceeded)
- ICMP responses to established connections
- **Use Case**: Network diagnostics, ping responses

#### 4. DNS Responses (If Queries Initiated)
- DNS responses to outbound queries
- Return DNS packets for established sessions
- **Use Case**: Domain name resolution responses

### ‚ùå BLOCKED TRAFFIC (Default Deny)

#### 1. New Inbound Connections
- **HTTP/HTTPS server traffic** (ports 80, 443)
- **SSH server access** (port 22)
- **Database connections** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- All unsolicited inbound connection attempts

#### 2. Application-Specific Services
- **Web servers** hosting websites
- **API endpoints** accepting requests
- **File sharing services** (FTP, SMB, NFS)
- **Email servers** (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
- **Game servers** and custom applications

#### 3. New Outbound Connections (Uncertain)
- May be blocked depending on AWS managed stateful rules
- Could require explicit allow rules
- Behavior varies by protocol and destination

## Comparative Analysis Across Firewalls

All tested firewalls show **identical restrictive configuration**:

| Firewall | Stateless | Stateful | Pattern |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| `net-a-internet` | `aws:forward_to_sfe` | `aws:drop_strict` | ‚úÖ Restrictive |
| `net-b-internet` | `aws:forward_to_sfe` | `aws:drop_strict` | ‚úÖ Restrictive |
| `net-a-gcc` | `aws:forward_to_sfe` | `aws:drop_strict` | ‚úÖ Restrictive |

## Practical Impact Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK (Definitely Blocked)
**Services that will NOT work without additional rules:**
- Web server hosting (Apache, Nginx)
- SSH server access from external sources
- Database server connections (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- File sharing services (FTP, SFTP, SMB)
- Email servers (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
- Game servers or custom application servers
- API endpoints accepting inbound requests

### üü° MEDIUM RISK (May Work - Depends on AWS Defaults)
**Services that might work due to AWS managed behaviors:**
- Outbound web browsing (client-initiated HTTP/HTTPS)
- Outbound email clients
- DNS lookups and resolution
- Software updates and downloads
- Client-side applications making outbound connections

### üü¢ LOW RISK (Should Work)
**Traffic guaranteed to work:**
- Return traffic for client-initiated connections
- Network diagnostics (ping responses)
- ICMP error messages for troubleshooting
- Established connection maintenance

## Security Implications

### Positive Security Aspects:
- ‚úÖ **Default-deny posture** prevents unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ **Explicit allow required** for services
- ‚úÖ **Attack surface minimization**
- ‚úÖ **Good for high-security environments**

### Operational Considerations:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **May break applications** without proper rule configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires explicit rules** for any services
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex troubleshooting** for connection issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Higher operational overhead** for rule management

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Add explicit allow rules** for required services
2. **Test applications thoroughly** before deployment
3. **Monitor connection failures** and add rules as needed
4. **Document required rules** for each application

### For Development/Testing:
1. Consider **more permissive policies** for development environments
2. Use **detailed logging** to understand blocked traffic patterns
3. **Gradually tighten policies** based on observed traffic

### Rule Development Strategy:
1. **Start with broad allow rules** for required services
2. **Monitor traffic patterns** through CloudWatch logs
3. **Refine rules** to be more specific over time
4. **Implement defense in depth** with multiple security layers

## Corrected Analysis Summary

**Previous Assessment**: ‚ùå "Highly Permissive"
**Corrected Assessment**: ‚úÖ "Highly Restrictive (Default Deny)"

**Key Learning**: The combination of:
- `StatelessDefaultActions: ["aws:forward_to_sfe"]` (pass-through)
- `StatefulDefaultActions: ["aws:drop_strict"]` (default deny)
- `StatefulRuleGroups: 0` (no explicit allows)

Results in a **security-first configuration** that blocks most traffic by default, relying only on AWS managed connection tracking for established flows.
